\label{sec:Reflection from a software engineering perspective}

The "Virtual Humans"-project was mostly divided into two separate products.
First of all their was the agent itself, and secondly their was the connector between the environment and the agents.
These two parts will be discussed separately. General software engineering principles will be  discussed first,
followed by software engineering aspects that relate to the two different products specifically.
