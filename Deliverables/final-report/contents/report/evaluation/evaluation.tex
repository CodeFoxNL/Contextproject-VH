\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will evaluate the state of the product compared to what we had in mind at the start of the project as well as evaluate what went wrong along the way.

\section{Evaluation of the product}
The product is, in it's entirety as it is today, not exactly as we envisioned at the start of the project.

\subsection{Product Plan evaluation} We have implemented all our \emph{must haves} as listed in our Product Plan, though we haven't (fully) implemented some \emph{should haves} and \emph{could haves}, most notably the following:

\emph{The agent should be able to make decisions which have a negative effect on its goals, if it has a great benefit that can later be utilized.} This \emph{should have} may have been too ambitious and, in retrospect, should have been listed as a \emph{could have}.

Another one that was not implemented is \emph{The agent should be able to ask other parties to perform actions which are beneficial to the goals of our agent}. This was not implemented because this level of communication and interaction with other agents is not implemented in both the other bots and the connector at this time. It turned out to be very difficult to achieve, because it requires carefully devised protocol messages or natural language processing.

\subsection{Business Plan evaluation} Our team started on the project by creating a general plan of what we want our agent should be capable of, these objectives were written down in our business plan. The business plan mainly describes strategies and possible actions, the way we expected that it would satisfy our client. During the project, we found out that this business plan was very optimistic concerning the state of the connector. Almost all our objectives written in there need a lot of spatial knowledge, something that the connector is not able to provide yet. Some of our requirements were: \emph{We prefer not to build houses near student houses}, \emph{We want to make sure that our residents have parking lots near their houses}, \emph{We want to build houses on ground that is not too close to roads that create a lot of noise disturbance}, \emph{We want to build houses near enough green so the residents will have a nice environment}. All of which require a lot of spatial information and calculations, which we thought the environment would be able to provide us. After the realisation that the environment was in a very poor state, these requirements were practically given up on.

We have implemented the requirements that \emph{We must obey all local restrictions.} and \emph{We want to renovate or rebuild outdated districts whenever they do not satisfy our conditions}.

\section{Evaluation of failures} At the end of the project we provided a product which did satisfy our client. We were not able to implement advanced decision logic or a well defined strategy. 
In sprint three we encountered the largest problem in the project. The connector was embarrassingly less developed than was assumed. The reaction to this was that the following weeks up to week seven was spent mostly to only on working on the connector to get it as far as we required it to be. Despite all efforts being made on the connector, we still ended up with less functionality than we needed to implement our business plan. 

Another issue arose with GOAL debugging, which stopped working and had not been fixed since, so we came up with a workaround to still be able to get some debug information while testing the bot. This caused some performance loss, because testing would take considerably longer.

In sprint six one of our members experienced a large problem with GOAL, because of which we practically lost one member for a week worth of work.
