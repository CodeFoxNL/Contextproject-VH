\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter we will evaluate the state of the product compared to what we had in mind at the start of the project as well as evaluate what went wrong along the way.

\section{Evalation of the product}
The product in it's entirety as it is today isn't exactly as we envisioned at the start of the project. We have implemented all our \emph{must haves} as listed in our Product Plan, though we haven't (fully) implemented some \emph{should haves} and \emph{could haves}. Most notably the following: \emph{The agent should be able to make decisions which have a negative effect on its goals, if it has a great benefit that can later be utilized.} This \emph{should have} may have been too ambitions and, in retrospect, should have been listed as a \emph{could have}.
