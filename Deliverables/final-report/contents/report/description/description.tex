\chapter[Description of Developed Functionalities]{Description of Developed \\ Functionalities}
In this chapter we will extensively describe the functionalities that we developed for our agent.

The agent that we have been working on fulfils the role of a Private Housing Corporation. What this corporation wants is to keep up and improve its reputation and obviously, to make profits. In order to achieve these two things we have designed our agent to take all necessary indicators in account. We will now provide an explanation per developed functionality based on the strategy that the agent has.

\section{Constructing Functionality}
When the agent has land without any buildings on it, for example from a previously demolished building, it will construct a new building here. Depending on the indicators for the balance and the environment, it will be luxury, normal or social housing.

\section{Upgrading Functionality}
The agent will adopt a goal to improve a zone whenever this certain zone does not live up to our standards according to the indicator target. We will then find buildings we own in this zone so that we can improve them and also the indicator numbers. 

\section{Buying Land Functionality}
Currently the agent is never looking to buy any land. However we will change this in the short future. When the agent gets a request from another stakeholder looking to sell land to us, we will always say no. We will change this later too. 

\section{Selling Land Functionality}
The agent will try to sell land that contains buildings on it that have nothing to do with housing, such as offices, leisure and other categories that do not fit our housing image. The agent makes an effort to sell these buildings to other stakeholders, to which they might be useful. It starts by trying to sell it to the Facilities stakeholder, as they are always looking to buy land. The agent will make a maximum of three attempts to sell the land to the potential buyer, each time with a slightly reduced price.
Whenever an agent sends us a request to buy land from us, we will decline the offer as we already have construction plans for all empty land that we possess.

\section{Demolishing Functionality}
When our agent attempted to sell land but it did not succeed, the agent will demolish the building so that some other building that will be more useful to us can be constructed. Also the agent will demolish social housing buildings whenever the indicator that gives the number of different kind of housings points out that we would like to have more luxury or normal housing.
