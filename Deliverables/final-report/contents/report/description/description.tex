\chapter[Description of Developed Functionalities]{Description of Developed \\ Functionalities}
This chapter describes developed functionalities for the connector and the GOAL agent.

The agent that we have been working on fulfils the role of a Private Housing Corporation. What this corporation wants is to keep up and improve its reputation and obviously, to make profit. In order to achieve these two things we have designed our agent to take all necessary indicators into account. We will now provide an explanation per developed functionality based on the strategy that the agent has.

\section{Connector} 
The connector was a joint effort by all groups which were working on this context project. Our group has done several contributions to the connector on which we will expand: The custom indicators, used to track progress of the stakeholder, the Upgrade Types percept, which makes it possible for a bot to use Upgrades, and the Extension of Buildings percept, which gave more functionality to our agent.

\paragraph{Custom Indicators}
The custom indicators percept was developed to make sure that every group had the possibility to create and update indicators which they deemed fit to reach their goal in the played session. It enabled the user to choose which information the indicator should send to the agent and it has been expanded throughout the process to accommodate every groups needs.

\paragraph{Upgrade Types}
The Upgrade Types percept is used by the agents to look which buildings they own can be upgraded into a building which would improve their indicators. The Upgrade Types percept was built to return an upgrade identifier with only one set of upgrades which could be called on by the agent, in the following weeks we noticed that some of the Upgrade Types had multiple sets and the percept was updated by project group RAMpestampers.

\paragraph{Extension of Buildings}
The Buildings percept has been extended with extra information regarding the zones in which a building had been built. This makes it possible for the agent to make a better decision on what to do with its owned buildings as he is aware in which zone they are located.

\section{GOAL Agent}
The agent was solely developed by our group and has the following functionalities which will be expanded on: Building and demolishing buildings, Upgrading Buildings, Buying and Selling land and communication with other stakeholders.

\paragraph{Building and Demolishing buildings}
The agent will build and demolish building which are available for him to build and demolish. It will also be focussed on building luxury housing and demolishing the amount of social housing. This is because the Private Housing Corporation is looking to improve the overall quality of housing in the zones they have buildings. Also buildings are demolished if they are not useful to the housing corporation and could not be sold to other stakeholders.

\paragraph{Upgrading buildings}
The agent will be looking to renovate as much buildings as possible to improve the overall quality of the housing in its zones if they were not chosen to be demolished for more modern housing. It is also used to keep the Municipality on its side by improving one of the Municipality's indicators, this might mean the Municipality will return a favor later into the session.

\paragraph{Selling expensive land}
The Housing Corporation owns a piece of land which is very expensive to work with because it contains a building it can't use and it is very expensive to demolish the building for a few extra houses. This is why the agent tries to sell this piece of land to other stakeholders, the agent offers this land to the other stakeholders on 3 different prices, the first price is 50 euros above the average price per $m^2$, the second price on the average price and the third price is 50 euros under the average price.

\paragraph{Communicating with other stakeholders}
The agent has communication with other stakeholders to a certain extent, it will always react on permits which he should react on. If another stakeholder tries to sell land to the agent and the agent has been trying to buy this land but the offer was never accepted the agent will look at the price the other stakeholder offers and decide if it wants to buy the land. This works in the same extent for land our agent is selling, if another stakeholder tries to buy land on a location the agent is selling the land it will take the price in consideration.
