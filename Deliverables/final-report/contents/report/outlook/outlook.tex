If, in the future, we were to work on this project again. All focus will be directed at developing the agent, since the connector is now fully functional.
Since a lot of time and effort was put into the development of the connector this time around, not everything we set out to implement was finished.
For instance, we think that the agent still lacks the ability to interact with other stakeholders.
Our biggest goal for when continuing with this project would be to be able to have a wide variety of outcomes when running our agent in conjunction with the agents for the other stakeholders.
