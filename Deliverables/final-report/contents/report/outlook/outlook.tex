If, in the future, we were to work on this project again, all focus would be directed at developing the agent, since the connector is now fully functional. Since a lot of time and effort was put into the development of the connector this time around, not everything we set out to implement was finished. For instance, we think that the agent still lacks the ability to interact with other stakeholders. Our biggest goal for when continuing with this project would be to be able to have a wide variety of outcomes when running our agent in conjunction with the agents for the other stakeholders.

In general we have learned that we need to be more assertive. Since progress should be made every week, we feel that we have been too reliant on other groups and the progress of the connector for this particular project. In future projects we want to make sure that progress is always made, this includes implementing something ourselves when it is needed immediately instead of relying on others. And where possible assign more people to tasks with big dependencies. Also we learned the importance of face to face interaction. Though online voice chat can be a great tool, it has to be accompanied by face to face contact, especially when the attendance for online meetings is low.
