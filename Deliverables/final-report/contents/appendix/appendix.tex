\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{What was your overall opinion of the game?}

\section*{A:}

\subsection*{An interesting game with a lot of information. It was really nice that you could see what would happen to your score when you built something, it gave you the idea that you could really experiment before you bought anything.}

\section*{Q:} 
\subsection*{What would you say about the decisions the other stakeholder made?}

\section*{A:}

\subsection*{I did not really get the feeling that the other stakeholder was playing the game right, it felt like he just wanted to try things just like me and it went really fast!}

\section*{Q:}

\subsection*{What did you think about the way the other stakeholder interacted with you?}

\section*{A:}

\subsection*{He gave me the option to buy one building from him, when I declined he tried it again with a lower price, it just felt like he was trying to use the sell button for the first time, when I tried to sell something to him he instantly declined, even when I put up a very high price, which I found very weird.}

\section*{Q:}

\subsection*{Do you think the other stakeholder was a human or a bot? why?}

\section*{A:}

\subsection*{With how fast he went I think it was a bot, it would explain why he did not really react on what I did and why he was really fast in trying to sell land to me.}

\section*{Test Subject 2}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{What was your overall opinion of the game?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{Not really my game, I never enjoyed games like this I am more into card games.}

\section*{Q:} 
\subsection*{What would you say about the decisions the other stakeholder made?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{I did not really look at what he was doing but I saw in the block of text on the right that he was always doing something, a lot was happening in the game, I could not follow all of it. I don't even believe you should be able to play the game that fast.}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{What did you think about the way the other stakeholder interacted with you?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{The only interaction I had with him was when he was trying to buy something from me, I just sold it to him. After that I tried to buy something from him but he did not even buy anything I was trying to sell him, even when it was at a very low price.}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{Do you think the other stakeholder was a human or a bot? why?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{A bot, clearly, that would explain why he was so fast but I find it weird that he never accepted anything I tried to sell him and he did not sell anything after that first building, was the bot broken? \textit{we told him why the bot would not do this.} That explains it but it was still easy to see that it was a bot because he was too fast.}

\section*{Test Subject 3}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{What was your overall opinion of the game?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{Honestly, I thought it was kinda boring. Nothing really happens except for the buildings that are being demolished or built. I would rather play SimCity then, as that is way more interactive.}

\section*{Q:} 
\subsection*{What would you say about the decisions the other stakeholder made?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{I did not really pay that much attention to the kind of things that the other stakeholder was doing, but it seemed that he was constantly constructing new buildings and upgrading buildings}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{What did you think about the way the other stakeholder interacted with you?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{I did not have that much interaction with the other stakeholder. He tried to sell a building to me a few times but I did not want it. After that he was probably done with me because he did not try to sell me anything anymore, or buy anything from me. Also he did not accept any offers that I made (maybe he was still mad because I did not want to buy his building).}

\section*{Q:}
\subsection*{Do you think the other stakeholder was a human or a bot? why?}

\section*{A:}
\subsection*{I think it was a bot since the only thing he was doing was demolishing, building and upgrading things (it was like he kept doing the same things over and over again). Other than that he did not seem to respond to anything that I was doing in the game.}
